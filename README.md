# My CV

This is my CV written in markdown and rendered by Jekyll.

The original version and code was forked and derived from Eliseo Papa ([Twitter](http://twitter.com/elipapa)/[GitHub](http://github.com/elipapa)/[website](https://elipapa.github.io)).

## Roadmap

- Content should be saved in individual data items (.yaml files maybe) instead of hard-coded into the index file.
- Make content mobile-friendly
- Preserve printing to PDF in a nice way
- Fix font issues across browsers
